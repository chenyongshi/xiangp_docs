===============================
Welcome to Pan’s documentation!
===============================

Theoretical calculation occupies an increasingly important place in scientific research, which relies on the rapid iterative updating of its methods and techniques. However, these new developing techniques are difficult to get started, tedious to learn, and inevitably forgotten. In order to record their own learning process, to facilitate future access, but also to leave some advice to those who come later, so this tutorial.

This tutorial has two versions, Chinese and English. Because it is my own creation, the update speed is a little slow. I plan to gradually complete the general framework in a year (set a flag, today is September 1, 2022), and will always update. If you want to participate, please submit a PR on the GitHub page of this project.

Please correct me for any deficiencies due to my limited skills!
